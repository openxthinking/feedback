## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/openxthinking/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.
